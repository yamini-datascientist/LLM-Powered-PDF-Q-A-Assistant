# LLM-Powered-PDF-Q-A-Assistant
Build a tool that ingests a set of PDF documents, indexes them in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone), and lets users ask questions. The answer should be generated using RAGâ€”retrieving relevant context chunks, then generating a response using an LLM (OpenAI API or open-source model).
